                        <p>Being a Sucker for Art, Video Games, and Music, these are my main hobbies 
                            that keep me motivated and curious to learn. But now that Iâ€™ve stumbled 
                            upon Software Engineering, It has brought me closer to everything I love doing. 
                            I hope to make this just as big as a passion as much as I love my hobbies. 
                            Knowing that this field of work is a huge piece that makes my everyday life 
                            a reality, I now know that software engineering is the magic that made my hobbies 
                            a reality and now want to use that magic to make my hobbies and more.
